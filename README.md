Liri Node Application

Rip-off Siri that takes command line arguments and pings Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB APIs.
Pass in my-tweets, spotify-this-song, or movie-this.
You can follow those with a Twitter handle, song, or movie, respectively, to get data for specific ones.
Defaults are set, so you don't have to type another argument in.
You can also just type whatever after you specified which program you're running. No need for quotes to keep it as one argument.

You can type run do-what-it-says, which pulls from the random.txt. You can edit the file to adjust the output, but keep formatting.

All useful data is stored in the log.txt file.
Please use your own .env file with Spotify and Twitter keys in order to use those functions.

Thanks and enjoy! Please reach out to me directly if anything is not functioning as expected.
